Download datasets from the following links and place them in this directory. Your directory tree should look like this

`Derain` <br/>
  `├──`[rainy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-_Tw-LHJF4vh8fpogKgZx1EQ9MhsJI_f?usp=sharing)  <br/>

`Dehaze` <br/>
  `├──`[synthetic](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-v0)  <br/>

For denoise dir, you could just put the clean images (e.g,  [BSD400](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1idKFDkAHJGAFDn1OyXZxsTbOSBx9GS8N/view?usp=sharing) and [WED](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~k29ma/exploration/)) into the directory. In the paper, we use the combination of BSD400 and WED as the training set.
