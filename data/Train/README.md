Download datasets from the following links and place them in this directory. Your directory tree should look like this

`Derain` <br/>
  `├──`[rainy]([Derain](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html))  <br/>
  `└──`gt <br/>

`Dehaze` <br/>
  `├──`[synthetic](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-v0)  <br/>
  `└──`original <br/>

For denoise dir, you could just put the clean images (e.g, BSD400 and [WED](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~k29ma/exploration/)) into the directory. In the paper, we use the combination of BSD400 and WED as the training set.
